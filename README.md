Lecture slides for UIUC ECE 401 Signal Processing

This repository contains code to generate the lecture slides for the [University 
of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/) course [ECE 401 (Signal Processing)](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/ece401). 
ECE 401 is designed for new graduate students who did not have a signal processing course
when they were undergraduates.  

This repository contains latex code for each slide deck, python code to generate most of the figures,
and Makefiles.  The Makefile should usually do the following thing: (1) run the python code to 
generate figures, (2) use wget to download any figures that come from online sources, (3) 
run pdflatex to make the slides.

In past semesters, these slides have been mostly CC-BY.  In fall 2023, I'm starting to release each individual
slide deck and its accompanying figure generation code into the public domain (CC0).  
The repository as a whole is CC0 (public domain).
