- specify that requests for help on problems should be made in office hours or on campuswire, not
by e-mail.

- specify that, if a student needs to post code on campuswire, that should be done in a private post.
Pseudo-code and algorithm descriptions can go in public posts.


Lecture 6:

Talk also about the aliasing that happens when you downsample from a high-sampling-rate signal to a low-sampling-rate signal.

Lecture 7:

Talk also about interpolation from low sampling rate to high sampling rate.


Lecture 8:

Define the discrete-time Fourier series.  Show how it relates to the continuous-time Fourier series.



Inverse Z: utility might not be obvious until after we've seen resonant systems?


Convolution: Define it in terms of adding together the echoes.  Show
how that gives the convolution formula.  Use that to define graphical
convolution in a new way?

Convolution: define the Z transform first, before the Fourier
transform?  Use it to show that convolution is just multiplying two
polynomials?
